**GOAL:** Study of adversarial capabilities and development of novel defense strategies for smartphone and IoT systems.

With smartphone penetration soaring and the rapid advancements in Internet connected devices, mobile and IoT device security guarantees are needed more than ever. Adversaries can leverage the fact that mobile devices are equipped with a multitude of sensing and their always present nature to launch sophisticated inference attacks to violate users’ confidentiality and the platforms’ integrity. This research thrust aims to study such adversarial capabilities in smartphone and IoT systems in consumer and enterprise settings.
