abstract: An increasing number of depth sensors and surrounding-aware cameras are
  being installed in the new generation of cars. For example, Tesla Motors uses a
  forward radar, a front-facing camera, and multiple ultrasonic sensors to enable
  its Autopilot feature. Meanwhile, older or legacy cars are expected to be around
  in volumes, for at least the next 10 to 15 years. Legacy car drivers rely on traditional
  GPS for navigation services, whose accuracy varies 5 to 10 meters in a clear line-of-sight
  and degrades up to 30 meters in a downtown environment. At the same time, a sensor-rich
  car achieves better accuracy due to high-end sensing capabilities. To bridge this
  gap, we propose CoDrive, a system to provide a sensor-rich car's accuracy to a legacy
  car. We achieve this by correcting GPS errors of a legacy car on an opportunistic
  encounter with a sensor-rich car. CoDrive uses smartphone GPS of all participating
  cars, RGB-D sensors of sensor-rich cars, and road boundaries of a traffic scene
  to generate optimization constraints. Our algorithm collectively reduces GPS errors,
  resulting in accurate reconstruction of a traffic scene's aerial view. CoDrive does
  not require stationary landmarks or 3D maps. We empirically evaluate CoDrive which
  is shown to achieve a 90% and a 30% reduction in cumulative GPS error for legacy
  and sensor-rich cars respectively, while preserving the shape of the traffic.
