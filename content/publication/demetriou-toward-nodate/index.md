abstract: Data is being created at an increasing rate by sources like the IoT devices,
  social media, and camera monitors. This data frequently includes sensitive information
  that parties must redact to adhere to laws and user privacy policies. At the same
  time, there is steady progress on recognizers that Ô¨Ånd latent information within
  rich data streams, and thereby create fresh privacy risks. In this work, we advocate
  the idea of developing a modular, extensible toolkit based on decognizers which
  are information hiding functions derived from recognizers that redact sensitive
  information. We offer steps towards an abstract conceptual framework and compositional
  techniques and discuss requirements for such a toolkit.
