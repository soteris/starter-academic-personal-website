abstract: 'Todayâ€™s smartphones can be armed with many types of external devices, such
  as medical devices and credit card readers, that enrich their functionality and
  enable them to be used in application domains such as healthcare and retail. This
  new development comes with new security and privacy challenges. Existing phone-based
  operating systems, Android in particular, are not ready for protecting authorized
  use of these external devices: indeed, any app on an Android phone that acquires
  permission to utilize communication channels like Bluetooth and Near Field Communications
  is automatically given the access to devices communicating with the phone on these
  channels.'
