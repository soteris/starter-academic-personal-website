abstract: In this paper we discuss the use of social media as tools for collaboratively
  creating content for location-sensitive mobile educational games. One of the main
  challenges for the broader adoption of location-based mobile games for learning
  is the process of creating useful content. End-users, e.g. teachers and facilitators
  who use such games may be actively involved in this process. We discuss experience
  of using tools for end-user content creation for two location-sensitive mobile games.
  The game design process is presented as the interplay between technology, learning
  and content with the content generation as a distinct phase of the process. Finally
  we discuss the opportunities and limitations of using social media for content-creation.
