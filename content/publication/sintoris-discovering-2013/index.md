abstract: 'In this paper we discuss how location-based mobile games can be designed
  for learning in modern technology enhanced public spaces. We start with the description
  of the design process and we identify the main challenges faced. We elaborate the
  case of the game Invisible City: Rebels vs. Spies, a game to be played in a city
  centre using mobile devices. Through this case we highlight the adaptation of an
  original party game into a mobile form, the issues we faced and the key aspects
  conductive to learning in a smart city. It is claimed that creating mobile city
  games for learning is a new challenge, as our city landscapes are augmented with
  an increasing number of layers of digital information in which a new generation
  of city games are played.'
