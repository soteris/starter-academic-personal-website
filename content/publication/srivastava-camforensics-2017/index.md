abstract: Many mobile apps, including augmented-reality games, bar-code readers, and
  document scanners, digitize information from the physical world by applying computer-vision
  algorithms to live camera data. However, because camera permissions for existing
  mobile operating systems are coarse (i.e., an app may access a camera's entire view
  or none of it), users are vulnerable to visual privacy leaks. An app violates visual
  privacy if it extracts information from camera data in unexpected ways. For example,
  a user might be surprised to find that an augmented-reality makeup app extracts
  text from the camera's view in addition to detecting faces. This paper presents
  results from the first large-scale study of visual privacy leaks in the wild. We
  build CamForensics to identify the kind of information that apps extract from camera
  data. Our extensive user surveys determine what kind of information users expected
  an app to extract. Finally, our results show that camera apps frequently defy users'
  expectations based on their descriptions.
